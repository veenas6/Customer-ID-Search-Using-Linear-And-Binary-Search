# 🔍 Linear & Binary Search (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This Python program demonstrates two classic searching algorithms:
- **Linear Search** → Sequentially checks each element.  
- **Binary Search** → Efficient search by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half.  

The program allows users to input an **ID number** and checks if it exists in a predefined list using both search methods.
